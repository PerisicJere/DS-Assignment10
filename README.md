- This is quicksort, I am using 6 pivot deciding methods from lectures. I am going to name them partition 1-6.
- Goal is to decide which partition is the best for QuickSort.
## Usage
- Compile
```bash
javac program10.java
```
- Run 
```bash
java -Xss1024m program10 car_sales_data.csv
```
- I am allocating more memory for stack, just in case.
